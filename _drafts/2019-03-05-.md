  Of Marketing Terms That All Mean The Same Thing
---
When I joined the architecture industry, fresh out of school, there were a whole host of terms I had to learn, but Window Treatment for some reason felt like the most egregious ... I think it was because the term is wholely comprised of words that I understand in English, but as a term being used in meetings it seemed to be referring to something else entirely. Eventually I summoned the courage in a meeting to ask *how* a contractor would add polarization or frosting to glass on site, and learned that in architectural terms, "Window Treatment" is just synonymous with "curtains or blinds", and I got a lot of corner of the mouth smiles and one sympathetic look from another engineer.

This was just one of my first exposure to architects' general love for creating new, and imho, often misleading, terms to describe the things that they come across, but I was reminded of this phenomena again recently when talking with a new hire. Our new Software Engineering lead has zero experience in the industry, and as part of the on boarding process I was trying to explain our various technology groups and the history of technology in our industry. And as I was actually having to think about and explain the terms that architects use to talk about technology, to someone who actually understands the nuts and bolts of that technology, I realized just how absurd I sounded. 

So I wanted to write this post (diatribe?) about the terminology of technology in architecture, and how it all kind of means the same thing.
