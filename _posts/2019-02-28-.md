title: 'C# - Simplifying Dictionaries With LINQ'
---
	var dict = myList.ToDictionary(i => i.UniqueID, i);

Whelp, I promised lofty talk about societal change, and we may get there, but first, let's discuss how we can use structured language queries to make extension methods useful for dealing with type-safe dictionaries ... :P

Lately I've been trying to write higher performance code by trying to make better use of Dictionaries and HashSets in C#. I've always known that they're a little slower to write to, and much faster to read from, but I didn't quite grasp the sheer performance gap until I was doing some research on HashSets and came across [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/10348367/8333865).



The main takeaways can probably be pretty immediately gleaned from these three graphs:

**Add 1000000 objects (without checking duplicates):**

**Contains check for half the objects of a collection of 10000:**

**Remove half the objects of a collection of 10000:**
![Add Tests](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MorzW.png)

With the above ContainsKey and Remove tests you can't even tell just how much faster the dicionary is because it's response time is below the margin of error. 

That being said, I often find Dictionaries cumbersome to work with in C#, I feel like they often clog up your code, and they're more difficult to use then my go-to List<> collection, especially once you've started adjusting to LINQ. 

So to make dictionaries a little more convenient, I started looking for some extension methods to make them a little more like collections and to make converting between collections and dictionaries a little easier. That's when I came across a SO post which I can't find anymore that essentially just used LINQ to pass a function that would be applied to a collection and I was inspired to create some of my own.

The first is **AddByKey**. This comes in handy if you've got any kind of enumerable collection of objects, and you want to add all of them to a dictionary, similar to a List's handy AddRange() function. But how would you pass in the key? 

Well LINQ saves the day by taking your collection of objects as an argument, and a LINQ function as the second argument that gets applied to that collection. So your calling code just looks like this:
	
    var objectList = new List<myObject>() { new myObject("UniqueID-1"), new myObject("UniqueID-2") };
	var dict = new Dictionary<string, myObject>();
    
    dict.AddByKey(objectList, item => item.UniqueID);
    
Which in my mind is a super clean and readable way of specifying what function you want applied to  each item in the list to be added. This is what the underlying extension method looks like:    

    public static void AddByKey<TKey, TValue>(this Dictionary<TKey, TValue> dict, 	IEnumerable<TValue> targets, Expression<Func<TValue, TKey>> propertyToAdd)
          {
              MemberExpression expr = (MemberExpression)propertyToAdd.Body;
              PropertyInfo prop = (PropertyInfo)expr.Member;

              foreach (var target in targets)
              {
                  var value = prop.GetValue(target);
                  if (!(value is TKey))
                      throw new Exception("Value type does not match the key type.");//shouldn't happen.
                  dict.Add((TKey)value, target);
              }
          }
 
Similarly, I ran into an issue where the Revit API gave me a list of RevitFamilies, and I wanted to wrap them in a little FamilyWrapper class that would pull some info and add some convenience methods. I also wanted all of these wrappers stored in a dictionary with the original family unique ID as the key so that I could immediately retrieve one of these already created families from the master list at a later point. 

So I made an extension method for any IEnumerable that will convert it to a dictionary based on two LINQ functions, creatively called **ToDictionary**. Calling it would look something like this:
  
	List<RevitFamily> familyList = document.GetFamilies();
	Dictionary<string,RevitFamilyWrapper> dict = objectList.ToDictionary(x => x.UniqueId, x => new RevitFamilyWrapper(x));
  
And that's it, now your collection is in a dictionary based on whatever transformations you want to apply to each item through LINQ. This is the code of the extension method:

    public static Dictionary<TKey, TValue> ToDictionary<TKey, TValue, TListItem>(this IEnumerable<TListItem> inList, Expression<Func<TListItem, TKey>> keyToAdd,
              Expression<Func<TListItem, TValue>> valueToAdd)
          {
              var outDict = new Dictionary<TKey, TValue>();
              MemberExpression keyExpr = (MemberExpression)keyToAdd.Body;
              PropertyInfo     keyProp = (PropertyInfo)keyExpr.Member;
              MemberExpression valueExpr = (MemberExpression)valueToAdd.Body;
              PropertyInfo     valueProp = (PropertyInfo)valueExpr.Member;

              foreach (var target in inList)
              {
                  var tempKey = keyProp.GetValue(target);
                  if (!(tempKey is TKey))
                      throw new Exception("Key type does not match the correct type.");//shouldn't happen.
                  var tempValue = valueProp.GetValue(target);
                  if (!(tempValue is TValue))
                      throw new Exception("Value type does not match the correct type.");//shouldn't happen.
                  outDict.Add((TKey)tempKey, (TValue)tempValue);
              }
              return outDict;
          }
