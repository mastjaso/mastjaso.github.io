  Of Marketing Terms That All Mean The Same Thing
---
When I joined the architecture industry fresh out of engineering school, there were a whole host of terms I had to learn, but for whatever reason, "Window Treatment" felt like the most egregiously unnessecary. I think it was because the term is wholely comprised of words that I understand in English, but as a term being used in meetings at an architecture firm, it seemed to be referring to something else entirely. Eventually I summoned the courage in a meeting to ask *how* a contractor would add polarization or frosting to glass on site, and with a lot of corner of the mouth smiles and one sympathetic look from another engineer, I learned that in architectural terms, "Window Treatment" is just synonymous with "curtains or blinds".

This was just one of my first exposure to architects' general love for creating new, and imho, often unnnessecary, terms to describe the things that they come across in their professionaly lives. However, I was reminded of this phenomena again recently, when talking with one of our new hires. Our Software Engineering lead had zero experience in the industry, and as part of the on boarding process I was trying to explain our various technology groups and the history of technology in our industry (as best I understood it at least). And as I was explaining the terms that architects use to talk about technology, to someone who actually understands the nuts and bolts of that technology, I realized just how absurd I sounded. 

So I wanted to write this post (diatribe?) about the terminology of technology in architecture, and how it all kind of means the same thing.
